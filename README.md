# Quizzler App

The **Quizzler App** is a simple quiz application built in Python to demonstrate coding proficiency and knowledge of Python fundamentals. This project is designed as a showcase for GitHub, emphasizing clean code and modular design. It includes features like fetching quiz questions, evaluating answers, and displaying results through an interactive UI.

## Features

- **Interactive Quiz Interface**: Users can answer quiz questions and get immediate feedback.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Questions are dynamically fetched and used in the quiz.
- **Modular Design**: Each component of the app (data, UI, quiz logic) is separated for maintainability and scalability.
- **Customizable**: Can be adapted for different types of quizzes by modifying `data.py`.
